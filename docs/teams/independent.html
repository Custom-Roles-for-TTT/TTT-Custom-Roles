                <p><span style="color:var(--independent);">Independents</span> have unique win conditions for each role. There is very little in common between different independents, and they can play completely different to each other. Typically, there are very few independents in each round.</p>
                <p>Most independents do not have their role known to any other players, and are not part of a team. Even if there are multiple different independents in the same round, they will often be competing against each other either directly or indirectly. However, there are exceptions to this as some independents have a goal of converting other players to their team. In these cases those players will be aware of each other's roles and can win together.</p>
                <p>Some independents are made aware of <span style="color:var(--jester);"><a href="../teams/jester.html">jesters</a></span>, and have the ability to see players who are dead but have not had their bodies found as "missing in action" on the scoreboard. These abilities are usually reserved for independents whose goal requires killing other players. Independents with a more passive goal will tend not to have these abilities.</p>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p><b>Example:</b> <code>ttt_independent_chance</code> is 0.5, <code>ttt_single_jester_independent</code> is 1, and <code>ttt_single_jester_independent_max_players</code> is 0 as per the default values above. As <code>ttt_single_jester_independent</code> is set to 1 there can only be a single jester or independent in each round. This means there is a 50% chance that a jester or independent will spawn in the round as <code>ttt_independent_chance</code> is set to 0.5. If <code>ttt_single_jester_independent</code> were instead set to 0, there is a 50% chance that an independent will spawn in the round and this independent could spawn in addition to a jester, but there will only ever be one of each. If <code>ttt_single_jester_independent_max_players</code> were now set to 8, this would mean that in games with 8 or less players only a single jester or independent could spawn, but in games with 9 or more players there is a chance for both a jester and an independent to spawn.</p>
                <p>If <code>ttt_multiple_jesters_independents</code> was set to 1, <code>ttt_independent_chance</code>, <code>ttt_single_jester_independent</code>, and <code>ttt_single_jester_independent_max_players</code> would all be ignored and the jester and independent roles are combined into one group. In this example there are eight players in the game, <code>ttt_jester_independent_pct</code> is 0.13, and <code>ttt_jester_independent_chance</code> is 0.5 as per the default values above. At most 13% of players (rounded up) can be jesters or independents as <code>ttt_jester_independent_pct</code> is set to 0.13. This means that there will be at most two jesters or independents. However, each of those players only has a 50% chance to be a jester or independent as <code>ttt_jester_independent_chance</code> is set to 0.5. This means it is possible for the round to have zero, one, or two jesters and independents. All remaining players who have not had a role assigned will be part of the innocent or monster teams.</p>
                <p>If you always wanted the same number of jesters and independents in each round with no variation, set <code>ttt_jester_independent_chance</code> to 1. Setting either <code>ttt_jester_independent_pct</code> or <code>ttt_jester_independent_chance</code> to 0 will make it impossible for jesters and independents to spawn while <code>ttt_multiple_jesters_independents</code> is enabled.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the following miscellaneous ConVars can be used to configure options that apply to all independents.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>When designing roles it is important to make sure your role is part of the correct team. Each team has a unique identity along with strengths and weaknesses that play better with some roles than others. If you are designing an independent role, keep the following in mind:</p>
                <b>Independents should:</b>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                    <li>Have unique win conditions, secondary win conditions, or some way of changing into a role that has a win condition.</li>
                    <li>Have some interesting mechanic or ability to help them toward their win condition or help with changing into a role that has a win condition.</li>
                    <li>Have a config option to be a part of the monster team instead if the role is a thematic fit.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Independents should <u>NOT</u>:</b>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                    <li>Rely on other players. Independents are independent after all and they generally have no team and no allies. If the role relies on other players, consider making them a traitor instead.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are just guidelines and in some special circumstances a role might be best fit as an independent even if it doesn't align with the above suggestions. However, in general following these suggestions will ensure that your role works well within the framework that Custom Roles for TTT provides.</p>
                <p>A walkthrough for creating your own role can be found on the <a href="../tutorials/create_your_own_role.html">Create Your Own Role</a> tutorial page.</p>

                <p>The <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--independent);"><i class="icon-arsonist"></i><a href="#arsonist">Arsonist</a></span> can douse players and set them on fire. They win if they are the last player alive.</p>

                    <p>They can douse players in gasoline by standing near them and then set them on fire using their igniter weapon once all other players have all been doused. If <code>ttt_arsonist_early_ignite</code> is enabled, the igniter weapon can be used at any time, but keep in mind it can only be used once.</p>
                    <p>Players are notified when they are doused after a configurable delay (see <code>ttt_arsonist_douse_notify_delay_min</code> and <code>ttt_arsonist_douse_notify_delay_max</code> below). This is to encourage Arsonists to be sneaky or blend in with other players to disguise themselves.</p>
                    <p>Dead players' corpses can also be doused and will be ignited with living doused players. Dousing all corpses is not required to activate the igniter when <code>ttt_arsonist_early_ignite</code> is disabled.</p>

                    <p>Which role the Drunk becomes depends on the situation and various ConVars (For example, <code>ttt_drunk_any_role</code>, <code>ttt_drunk_can_be_*</code>, <code>ttt_drunk_become_clown</code>, <code>ttt_drunk_innocent_chance</code>, and <code>ttt_drunk_join_losing_team</code>). By default, the Drunk will join the losing team and become their most basic role (e.g. the <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--innocent);"><i class="icon-innocent"></i><a href="../teams/innocent.html#innocent">Innocent</a></span> for the innocent team and the <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--traitor);"><i class="icon-traitor"></i><a href="../teams/traitor.html#traitor">Traitor</a></span> for the traitor team) in the case of the round ending. If the Drunk is remembering their role due to the sober timer running out, they have a 70% chance of becoming an Innocent and, therefore, a 30% chance of becoming a Traitor.</p>

                    <p>Killing a player with their claws will turn the target into a Zombie thrall.</p>
                    <p>By using the secondary attack with the claws, Zombies can leap in the air to surprise their potential targets. This can be disabled by changing <code>ttt_zombie_leap_enabled</code>.</p>
                    <p>If the target is out of range of the claws, the Zombie can spit acid at them by pressing the reload button. This can be disabled by changing <code>ttt_zombie_spit_enabled</code>. Killing a player with acid spit will not convert them unless <code>ttt_zombie_spit_convert</code> is enabled.</p>
                    <p>When <code>ttt_zombie_vision_enabled</code> is enabled, their hunger for brains helps them see their targets through walls by highlighting their enemies.</p>
                    <p>If <code>ttt_zombie_show_target_icon</code> is enabled, their targets can also be identified by the skull icon floating over their heads.</p>
                    <p>To encourage the use of their claws, Zombies do less damage with other weapons. This can be adjusted or disabled via the <code>ttt_zombie_damage_penalty</code> ConVar. <code>ttt_zombie_damage_reduction</code> can be set to cause the Zombies to take less bullet damage from other players, allowing them to survive more easily when attacking.</p>
                    <p>Any Zombie that spawns into a round at the beginning is known as a prime Zombie. Prime Zombies are special compared to Zombie thralls (the Zombies created by the prime), in that by default only the prime Zombie can use weapons other than their claws. This behavior can be disabled via the <code>ttt_zombie_prime_only_weapons</code> ConVar. Furthermore, the prime Zombie does more damage and can attack faster compared to the thralls, but all of that can be adjusted by the <code>ttt_zombie_prime_*</code> and <code>ttt_zombie_thrall_*</code> ConVars (see more information below).</p>
                    <p>The Zombie has access to a shop containing a small handful of useful perks. Zombies start with no credits but receive a credit whenever they convert another player into a Zombie.</p>
                    <p>The Zombie can optionally be part of the <span style="color:var(--traitor)"><a href="../teams/traitor.html">traitor team</a></span> or <span style="color:var(--monster)"><a href="../teams/monster.html">monster team</a></span> instead of being an independent by enabling <code>ttt_zombie_is_traitor</code> or <code>ttt_zombie_is_monster</code> respectively. However, the Mad Scientist will only be able to spawn if the Mad Scientist and the Zombie are part of the same team.</p>
