                <p>The <span style="color:var(--innocent);">innocent team</span> is one of the two primary teams in play in a game of Trouble in Terrorist Town.</p>
                <p>The main goal of the innocent team is to identify and eliminate all members of the <span style="color:var(--traitor);"><a href="../teams/traitor.html">traitor team</a></span>. In some cases, they also need to take out <span style="color:var(--monster);"><a href="../teams/monster.html">monsters</a></span>, <span style="color:var(--jester);"><a href="../teams/jester.html">jesters</a></span>, or <span style="color:var(--independent);"><a href="../teams/independent.html">independents</a></span> that could prevent their victory.</p>
                <p>Members of the innocent team do not have their roles known to any other players, and they usually lack a definitive method to prove their innocence. This puts the innocent team at a significant disadvantage compared to the traitor team, whose roles are known to each other. To address this, most games have a higher number of innocent players than traitors.</p>
                <p><span style="color:var(--detective);"><a href="../teams/detective.html">Detectives</a></span> are also part of the innocent team, sharing the same objective, but their allegiance is known to all players.</p>

                <p>The following ConVars can be used to configure the requirements and restrictions on how innocents spawn.</p>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p><b>Example:</b> There are four members of the innocent team. <code>ttt_special_innocent_pct</code> is 0.33, and <code>ttt_special_innocent_chance</code> is 0.5 as per the default values above. At most 33% of the innocent team (rounded up) can be special innocents as <code>ttt_special_innocent_pct</code> is set to 0.33. This means that there will be at most two special innocents. However, each of those two players only has a 50% chance to be a special innocent as <code>ttt_special_innocent_chance</code> is set to 0.5. This means it is possible for the round to have zero, one, or two special innocents. All remaining members of the innocent team will each be an <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--innocent);"><i class="icon-innocent"></i><a href="#innocent">Innocent</a></span>.</p>
                <p>If you wanted it to be possible for all members of the innocent team to be special innocents at once, set <code>ttt_special_innocent_pct</code> to 1. Alternately, if you always wanted the same number of special innocents in each round with no variation, set <code>ttt_special_innocent_chance</code> to 1. Setting either <code>ttt_special_innocent_pct</code> or <code>ttt_special_innocent_chance</code> to 0 will make it impossible for special innocents to spawn.</p>

            <button class="header" style="cursor: default; background-color:#555555">Role Guidelines</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>When designing roles it is important to make sure your role is part of the correct team. Each team has a unique identity along with strengths and weaknesses that play better with some roles than others. If you are designing a role for the innocent team, keep the following in mind:</p>
                <b>Innocents should:</b>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                    <li>Win by working with other innocents and detectives to identify and kill the traitors.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Innocents should <u>NOT</u>:</b>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                    <li>Have unique win conditions. If your role requires a unique win condition consider making them a jester or independent.</li>
                    <li>Have any reason to kill/damage/annoy other innocents and detectives. If your role wants to cause chaos and confusion consider making them a traitor, jester or independent.</li>
                    <li>Use identifiable weapons/mechanics that could reveal their role to others. If your role identifiable weapons/mechanics consider the following: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your role might be a better fit as a traitor. Traitors need to hide their role from others so identifiable weapons/mechanics will want to be kept hidden.</li>
                        <li>Your role might be a better fit as a detective. Detectives are known to all players so identifiable weapons/mechanics provide no new information.</li>
                        <li>Your role might be a better fit as an independent. Independents are flexible roles that can be used in many different ways so identifiable weapons/mechanics might be okay.</li>
                        <li>Add a mirror role to the traitor or independent team such as the <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--special-innocent);"><i class="icon-deputy"></i><a href="#deputy">Deputy</a></span> and the <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--special-traitor);"><i class="icon-impersonator"></i><a href="../teams/traitor.html#impersonator">Impersonator</a></span>. A mirror role means that any identifiable weapons/mechanics can't be used to determine a player's team.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>These are just guidelines and in some special circumstances a role might be best fit as an innocent even if it doesn't align with the above suggestions. However, in general following these suggestions will ensure that your role works well within the framework that Custom Roles for TTT provides.</p>
                <p>A walkthrough for creating your own role can be found on the <a href="../tutorials/create_your_own_role.html">Create Your Own Role</a> tutorial page.</p>

                <p>The <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--special-innocent);"><i class="icon-deputy"></i><a href="#deputy">Deputy</a></span> is promoted to replace the <span style="color:var(--detective);"><a href="../teams/detective.html">detective</a></span> in the event of their death.</p>
                <div class="expansion">
                    <p>Once promoted, they have all the powers of a detective including access to <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--detective);"><i class="icon-detective"></i><a href="../teams/detective.html#detective">Detective</a></span> weapons and the ability to search bodies.</p>
                    <p>By default, there is no downside to being an un-promoted Deputy for the whole round. However, if the <code>ttt_deputy_damage_penalty</code> ConVar is changed from its default, they may do less damage until promoted.</p>
                    <p>The icon shown over the head of a promoted Deputy depends on the <code>ttt_deputy_use_detective_icon</code> setting. By default, the Detective icon will be used.</p>
                    <p>The Deputy has access to a shop, but by default it is only available once they are promoted. The <code>ttt_deputy_shop_active_only</code> and <code>ttt_deputy_shop_delay</code> ConVars can change the behavior of when the shop is available and what happens when it's used.</p>

                    <p>By default, when the Phantom is killed they haunt their killer. While haunting a player, the Phantom can use one of their haunting abilities to try and get their killer killed, causing them to respawn. This behavior can be disabled by disabling <code>ttt_phantom_killer_haunt</code>.</p>
                    <p>
                        The haunting abilities that the Phantom has are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attack - Make the haunted player use their current weapon for a short time</li>
                            <li>Drop Weapon - Make the haunted player drop their current weapon</li>
                            <li>Jump - Make the haunted player jump</li>
                            <li>Move - Make the haunted player move in the specified direction for a short time</li>
                        </ul>
                        Each of these abilities can be adjusted or disabled via the ConVars listed below.
