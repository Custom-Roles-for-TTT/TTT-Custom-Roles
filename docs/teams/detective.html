            <p><span style="color:var(--detective);">Detectives</span> are part of the <span style="color:var(--innocent);"><a href="../teams/innocent.html">innocent team</a></span>, however they have unique advantages and disadvantages compared to other innocents.</p>
            <p>The main goal of detectives, and by extension the innocent team, is to identify and eliminate all members of the <span style="color:var(--traitor);"><a href="../teams/traitor.html">traitor team</a></span>. In some cases, they also need to take out <span style="color:var(--monster);"><a href="../teams/monster.html">monsters</a></span>, <span style="color:var(--jester);"><a href="../teams/jester.html">jesters</a></span>, or <span style="color:var(--independent);"><a href="../teams/independent.html">independents</a></span> that could prevent their victory.</p>
            <p>Detectives have their role known to all players, as such they usually act as the de facto leader of the innocent team. They also have the ability to search dead bodies of players and uncover their role and information about their death. This information is often vital to the success of the innocent team and can make detectives high priority targets for the traitors.</p>

            <p><b>Example:</b> There are eight players in the game. <code>ttt_detective_pct</code> is 0.13, <code>ttt_special_detective_pct</code> is 0.33, and <code>ttt_special_detective_chance</code> is 0.5 as per the default values above. 13% of the players in the game (rounded up) will spawn as detectives as <code>ttt_detective_pct</code> is set to 0.13. This means there will be two players that are detectives. At most 33% of those detectives (rounded up) can be special detectives as <code>ttt_special_detective_pct</code> is set to 0.33. This means that there will be at most one special detective. However, that player only has a 50% chance to be a special detective as <code>ttt_special_detective_chance</code> is set to 0.5. This means it is possible for the round to have zero or one special detective. All remaining detectives will each be a <span class="inline-icon" style="color:var(--detective);"><i class="icon-detective"></i><a href="#detective">Detective</a></span>.</p>
            <p>If you wanted it to be possible for all detectives to be special detectives at once, set <code>ttt_special_detective_pct</code> to 1. Alternately, if you always wanted the same number of special detectives in each round with no variation, set <code>ttt_special_detective_chance</code> to 1. Setting either <code>ttt_special_detective_pct</code> or <code>ttt_special_detective_chance</code> to 0 will make it impossible for special detectives to spawn.</p>

        <button class="header" style="cursor: default; background-color:#555555">Role Guidelines</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When designing roles it is important to make sure your role is part of the correct team. Each team has a unique identity along with strengths and weaknesses that play better with some roles than others. If you are designing a detective role, keep the following in mind:</p>
            <b>Detectives should:</b>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <li>Win by working with innocents and other detectives to identify and kill the traitors.</li>
                <li>Be able to search and identify bodies.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Detectives should <u>NOT</u>:</b>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <li>Have unique win conditions. If your role requires a unique win condition consider making them a jester or independent.</li>
                <li>Have any reason to kill/damage/annoy innocents and other detectives. If your role wants to cause chaos and confusion consider making them a traitor, jester or independent.</li>
                <li>Have any reason to stay hidden from players. Detectives are meant to be a public team leader for the innocents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just guidelines and in some special circumstances a role might be best fit as a detective even if it doesn't align with the above suggestions. However, in general following these suggestions will ensure that your role works well within the framework that Custom Roles for TTT provides.</p>
            <p>A walkthrough for creating your own role can be found on the <a href="../tutorials/create_your_own_role.html">Create Your Own Role</a> tutorial page.</p>

                <p>The Detective also spawns with a DNA scanner that can be used to track down players using DNA samples left on dead bodies, weapons, or other items. Samples do not last forever and will decay if they are not collected quickly. Once a sample has been collected the DNA scanner will provide frequent updates that point towards the player that the sample belongs to.</p>
                <p>Unlike most unique role items, the DNA scanner can be dropped and used by other players of any role.</p>
