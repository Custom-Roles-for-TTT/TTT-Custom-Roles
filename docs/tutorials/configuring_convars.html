        <h1>ConVars</h1>
        <p>Console variables (or ConVars) are used by games running on Source engine such as Garry's Mod to configure various options. As the name implies, ConVars are often viewed or changed from the console. However, in most cases, changes made via the console will only be temporary and will reset when the server restarts or the map changes.</p>
        <p>This page will provide a list of server ConVars that can be used to configure Custom Roles for TTT, as well as instructions on setting up your server so that your ConVars won't be automatically reset.</p>
        <p>A list of ConVars from base Trouble in Terrorist Town can be found on their website's <a href="http://www.troubleinterroristtown.com/config/settings/" target="_blank">Server Settings</a> page.</p>
        <p>This tutorial will not explain how to create a Garry's Mod server from scratch, only how to configure them for Custom Roles for TTT.</p>

        <h2 id="config-files">Config Files</h2>
        <p>As ConVars reset every time the server restarts or the map changes, it is important to create a config file that will automatically update ConVars to the desired value any time this happens.</p>

        <h3 id="listen-servers-vs-dedicated-servers">Listen Servers vs Dedicated Servers</h3>
        <p>There are two types of Garry's Mod servers and they each need to be configured through different files. The process is otherwise identical but make sure you know which type of server you are running and have the correct file path before continuing.</p>
        <p>If you are starting a multiplayer game from within the Garry's Mod client then you are running a <b>listen server</b>. The config file for listen servers is located within your Garry's Mod game files. In Steam, right click on Garry's Mod and select 'Manage', then 'Browse local files'. An explorer window should open to the folder containing your Garry's Mod game files. Open 'garrysmod', then 'cfg'. Inside this folder is a file named 'listenserver.cfg' which is the config file you should use for the rest of the tutorial.</p>
        <p>If you are running your server separately from your Garry's Mod client, either through another process or a server hosting platform, you are running a <b>dedicated server</b>. The config file for dedicated servers is located inside the server folders. Open the folder containing your server and open 'garrysmod', then 'cfg'. Inside this folder is a file named 'server.cfg' which is the config file you should use for the rest of the tutorial.</p>

        <h3 id="editing-config-files">Editing Config Files</h3>
        <p>Once you have located your config file, open it using a plain text editor such as Notepad. You can add ConVars to this file such that each line contains a single ConVar followed by one or more spaces and then the value you want to set that ConVar to. Comments can be added to the file by typing '//'. Anything after those slashes on the same line will be ignored when the file is loaded by the server. This allows you to write notes and reminders to help organise your config file. Blank lines will also be ignored by the server allowing you to organise ConVars into groups.</p>
        <p>ConVars can come in four different types. Depending on the type you may need to format the ConVar value in a specific way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Integers</b> require whole number values. Any decimal values will be rounded down and anything that isn't a number will be treated as if it were 0. (e.g. <code>ttt_example_integer_convar 15</code> will set the value of the ConVar <code>ttt_example_integer_convar</code> to 15.)</li>
            <li><b>Floats</b> are numbers that can be decimals or whole numbers. Anything that isn't a number will be treated as if it were 0. (e.g. <code>ttt_example_float_convar 0.33</code> will set the value of the ConVar <code>ttt_example_float_convar</code> to 0.33.)</li>
            <li><b>Booleans</b> are true or false values. For true use a value of 1 and for false use a value of 0. (e.g. <code>ttt_example_boolean_convar 0</code> will set the value of the ConVar <code>ttt_example_boolean_convar</code> to false.)</li>
            <li><b>Strings</b> are text. When setting the value of a string ConVar, you need to surround the text you want to provide as the value with quotation marks. (e.g. <code>ttt_example_string_convar "test"</code> will set the value of the ConVar <code>ttt_example_string_convar</code> to "test".)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is an example of what a functional config file could look like:</p>
        <div><pre><code class="language-c++">ttt_example_convar 1 // This text will be ignored because it comes after two slashes
ttt_another_example 0.5 // This line will set the value of the ConVar 'ttt_another_example' to 0.5
ttt_yet_another_example           10 // You can have as many spaces as you want between the ConVar and its value
// Comments can take up full lines and lines can even be left blank

// ConVars can use whole numbers (integers), decimals (floats), true/false (booleans), or text (strings) as their values
ttt_boolean_convar 0 // If a ConVar requires true or false (otherwise known as a 'boolean') as its value, use 0 for false and 1 for true
ttt_another_boolean 1 // This line would set the value of the ConVar 'ttt_another_boolean' to true

ttt_string_convar "hello" // If a ConVar requires text (otherwise known as a 'string') as its value, put the text inside quotation marks
ttt_another_string "custom roles for ttt" // This line would set the value of the ConVar 'ttt_another_string' to "custom roles for ttt"</code></pre></div>
        <p>A full list of Custom Roles for TTT ConVars and their default values in a config file ready format can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/Custom-Roles-for-TTT/TTT-Custom-Roles/blob/release/CONVARS.md" target="_blank">Custom Roles for TTT GitHub repository</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="custom-roles-for-ttt-convars">Custom Roles for TTT ConVars</h2>
        <p>Custom Roles for TTT has over 800 ConVars that can be used to customise your server. Most of these ConVars are unique to each role and won't be listed here, but you can find them in the expandable sections for each role on their respective team's page.</p>

        <h3 id="shared-role-convars">Shared Role ConVars</h3>
        <p>Some ConVars are automatically generated for each role and have been grouped here to save space. For each of these ConVars replace the '<b>*</b>' with the name of the role you want to configure in lower case and without spaces.</p>
